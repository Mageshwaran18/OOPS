Overloading Methods:
In Java, it is possible to define two or more methods within the same class that share the same name,
as long as their parameter declarations are different.
While overloaded methods may have different return types, the return type alone is insufficient to distinguish two
versions of a method. When Java encounters a call to an overloaded method, it simply executes the version of the method
whose parameters match the arguments used in the call.
In some cases, Javaâ€™s automatic type conversions can play a role in overload resolution.

class OverloadDemo {
    void test(double a){
        System.out.println("Inside test(double) a: " + a);
    }
}
class Overload {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
         OverloadDemo ob = new OverloadDemo();
         int i = 88;
         ob.test(i);        // this will invoke test(double)
         ob.test(123.2);    // this will invoke test(double)
     }
}
As you can see, this version of OverloadDemo does not define test(int). Therefore, when test( ) is called with an
integer argument inside Overload, no matching method is found. However, Java can automatically convert an integer
into a double, and this conversion can be used to resolve the call. Therefore, after test(int) is not found,
Java elevates i to double and then calls test(double).
Of course, if test(int) had been defined, it would have been called instead.
Java will employ its automatic type conversions only if no exact match is found.

Returning Objects:

 // Returning an object.
       class Test {
           int a;
             Test(int i) {
                 a = i;
            }
            Test incrByTen() {
                Test temp = new Test(a+10);
                return temp;
            }
       }
       class RetOb {
         public static void main(String args[]) {
           Test ob1 = new Test(2);
           Test ob2;
           ob2 = ob1.incrByTen();
           System.out.println("ob1.a: " + ob1.a);
           System.out.println("ob2.a: " + ob2.a);
       }
}

Output:
ob1.a: 2
ob2.a: 12

As you can see, each time incrByTen( ) is invoked, a new object is created, and a reference to it is returned to the
calling routine. Since all objects are dynamically allocated using new, you donâ€™t need to worry about an object going
out-of-scope because the method in which it was created terminates. The object will continue to exist as long as there
is a reference to it somewhere in your program. When there are no references to it, the object will be reclaimed the
next time garbage collection takes place.


public class Main {

    static class Test {
        int a;

        Test(int i) {
            a = i;  // âœ… Automatically refers to the current object's 'a'
        }

        Test incrByTen() {
            Test temp = new Test(a + 10);  // âœ… 'a' refers to 'this.a' of ob1
            return temp;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test ob1 = new Test(2);  // ob1.a = 2
        Test ob2;

        ob2 = ob1.incrByTen();  // Creates new Test object with a = 2 + 10 = 12

        System.out.println("ob1.a: " + ob1.a);  // Output: ob1.a: 2
        System.out.println("ob2.a: " + ob2.a);  // Output: ob2.a: 12
    }
}


**"In Java, instance variables are implicitly accessed using the current object (`this`), so explicitly using `this` is only necessary when there is a naming conflict (e.g., when a method parameter has the same name as an instance variable)."** ðŸš€
